  Application Information
subquestion: |
    <p>Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County is a private, non-profit law firm that provides free legal services to eligible individuals and families. This screening application is our way to collect the information we need to complete the following three steps: </p>
    
    <p style="margin-left: 20px"><strong>1. We must first check to be sure we do not have a <span style="text-decoration: underline">conflict of interest</span> due to our prior or current representation of someone connected with your case.</strong> To do this we need the correct spelling of both your name and the adverse party’s name.</p>

    <p>If a conflict of interest exists, LASSMC will not be able to assist you. We will inform you as soon as possible that we cannot provide any legal advice or representation. </p>
    
    <p style="margin-left: 20px"><strong>2. We then must check to be sure that you are <span style="text-decoration: underline">financially eligible</span> for our services.</strong></p>
    
    <p>A preliminary determination about your financial eligibility for our services is made according to income and asset information on the application, subject to a more thorough evaluation later. </p>
    
    <p style="margin-left: 20px"><strong>3. Finally, we must screen your case to see if your situation meets the <span style="text-decoration:underline">priorities of our office.</span></strong></p>
    
    <p>LASSMC has limited resources, and so we must prioritize which cases we take. Priorities are established and approved by our governing board. A copy of our priorities is available upon request. </p>
    
    <p class="text-center" style="border: 1px solid black; padding:20px"><strong>PLEASE NOTE AT THIS TIME OUR OFFICE IS NOT REPRESENTING YOU AND THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE IN THIS APPLICATION SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED PRIVILEGED AND IN NO WAY CREATES AN ATTORNEY CLIENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND LEGAL AID SOCIETY OF SAN MATEO COUNTY</strong></p>
    
    <p>We will make every attempt to let you know whether we can accept your case within <strong>two weeks</strong> of receiving your application. Please let us know if you have an emergency situation, and we will try to address your application on an expedited basis. </p>

  ###AGREEMENT FOR LIMITED SCOPE LEGAL SERVICES
  
  Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County staff and volunteers will meet with you and provide a free legal consultation about your housing issue. During that consultation, we will provide you with legal advice, and if appropriate we may assist you with completing legal forms or letter templates during the consultation. 

  I understand that the staff and volunteers of Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County are providing only advice and limited services at the time of my scheduled consultation, and are not representing me in any capacity. I understand that if Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County agrees to represent me or provide additional legal services after my consultation, then an additional retainer agreement will be signed by me and Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County staff to confirm the nature of that representation or service.  
  
  I understand that Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County staff and volunteers will protect the confidentiality of all information shared by me in my legal consultation. Confidential information about my household and legal issue will be available only to the staff and volunteers of the network of legal services agencies who may work together to help me with my legal housing problems, which includes Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County, Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto, and the Stanford Community Law Clinic. These three agencies may work together and share information among lawyers who might be able to help me, in order to secure the most legal assistance available to me.  
  
  I understand that Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County is a nonprofit law office, and is providing free legal service to me based on my eligibility as a low income resident of San Mateo County.
